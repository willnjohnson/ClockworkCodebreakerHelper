# Clockwork Codebreaker Helper

This Greasemonkey script assists with the Clockwork Codebreaker game on Neopets by helping deduce the correct code through an interactive UI.
It keeps track of your attempts, feedback, and narrows down the possible combinations based on your inputs.

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use this GreaseMonkey script, you can use my Codepen version below:

Enjoy, and hope you earn that easy gold trophy!
